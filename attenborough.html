        <h3 class="text-center mt-5 mb-3">A timeline of David Attenborough's life and his journey through broadcasting:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
						<strong>8 May 1926</strong> - Born in Isleworth, West London.
					</li>
          <li>
						<strong>1936</strong> - David and his brother Richard attended a lecture by Grey Owl (Archibald Belaney) at De Montfort Hall, Leicester, and were influenced by his advocacy of conservation.
					</li>
          <li>
						<strong>1945</strong> - Won a scholarship to Clare College, Cambridge.
					</li>
          <li>
						<strong>1947</strong> - David was called up for national service in the Royal Navy and spent two years stationed in North Wales and the Firth of Forth.
					</li>
          <li>
						<strong>1950</strong> - David married Jane Elizabeth Ebsworth Oriel.
					</li>
          <li>
						<strong>1950</strong> - David applied for a job as a radio talk producer with the BBC, he was rejected for this job.
					</li>
          <li>
						<strong>1952</strong> - However, he accepted Mary Adams' offer of a three-month training course. Adams, head of the Talks (factual broadcasting) department of the BBC's fledgling television service
					</li>
          <li>
						<strong>1952</strong> - David Attenborough joined the BBC full-time. Initially discouraged from appearing on camera because Adams thought his teeth were too big,he became a producer for the Talks department, which handled all non-fiction broadcasts.
					</li>
          <li>
						<strong>1957</strong> - the BBC Natural History Unit was formally established in Bristol. Attenborough was asked to join it, but declined, not wishing to move from London where he and his young family were settled. Instead, he formed his own department, the Travel and Exploration Unit,[24] which allowed him to continue to front Zoo Quest as well as produce other documentaries
					</li>
          <li>
						<strong>1960</strong> - In the early 1960s, Attenborough resigned from the permanent staff of the BBC to study for a postgraduate degree in social anthropology at the London School of Economics, interweaving his study with further filming.[25] However, he accepted an invitation to return to the BBC as controller of BBC Two before he could finish the degree. He rebuffed Terry Wogan's job application to be a BBC presenter as "to have two Irishmen presenting on BBC Two would have looked ridiculous"
					</li>
          <li>
						<strong>1965</strong> - Attenborough became the controller of BBC Two in March, but had a clause inserted in his contract that would allow him to continue making programmes on an occasional basis. Later the same year, he filmed elephants in Tanzania
					</li>
          <li>
						<strong>1969</strong> - He made a three-part series on the cultural history of the Indonesian island of Bali. 
					</li>
          <li>
						<strong>1971</strong> - For the 1971 film A Blank on the Map, he joined the first Western expedition to a remote highland valley in New Guinea to seek out a lost tribe.
					</li>
          <li>
						<strong>1973</strong> - When Attenborough's name was being suggested as a candidate for the position of Director-General of the BBC in 1972 he phoned his brother Richard to confess that he had no appetite for the job. Early the following year, he left his post to return to full-time programme-making, leaving him free to write and present the planned natural history epic
					</li>
          <li>
						<strong>1973</strong> - After his resignation, Attenborough became a freelance broadcaster and immediately started work on his next project, a pre-arranged trip to Indonesia with a crew from the Natural History Unit. It resulted in the 1973 series Eastwards with Attenborough, which was similar in tone to the earlier Zoo Quests but without the animal-collecting element.
					</li>
          <li>
						<strong>1979</strong> - Beginning with Life on Earth in 1979, Attenborough set about creating a body of work which became a benchmark of quality in wildlife film-making and influenced a generation of documentary film-makers.
					</li>
          <li>
						<strong>1984</strong> - The success of Life on Earth prompted the BBC to consider a follow-up, and five years later, The Living Planet was screened. This time, Attenborough built his series around the theme of ecology, the adaptations of living things to their environment. It was another critical and commercial success, generating huge international sales for the BBC.
					</li>
          <li>
						<strong>1993</strong> - In 1993 he presented Life in the Freezer, the first television series to survey the natural history of Antarctica. Although past normal retirement age,
					</li>
          <li><strong>1995</strong> - Although past normal retirement age, he then embarked on a number of more specialised surveys of the natural world, beginning with plants. They proved a difficult subject for his producers, who had to deliver five hours of television featuring what are essentially immobile objects. The result, The Private Life of Plants, showed plants as dynamic organisms by using time-lapse photography to speed up their growth.</li>
          <li><strong>1998</strong> - The Life of Birds. Prompted by an enthusiastic ornithologist at the BBC Natural History Unit, Attenborough then turned his attention to the animal kingdom and in particular, birds. The documentary series won a Peabody Award the following year.</li>
          <li><strong>2008</strong> - At this point, Attenborough realised that he had spent 20 years unconsciously assembling a collection of programmes on all the major groups of terrestrial animals and plants – only reptiles and amphibians were missing. When Life in Cold Blood was broadcast in 2008, he had the satisfaction of completing the set, brought together in a DVD encyclopaedia called Life on Land.</li>

If you'd asked me 20 years ago whether we'd be attempting such a mammoth task, I'd have said "Don't be ridiculous!" These programmes tell a particular story and I'm sure others will come along and tell it much better than I did, but I do hope that if people watch it in 50 years' time, it will still have something to say about the world we live in.&rdquo;</p>
