## Synopsis

This a a repo where I plan to store my somewhat larger FreeCodeCamp projects. Projects that took longer than a few hours to create and where making a git repo of the project seemed usefull. Project where I took more time than I should have that I decided to complete to a higher standard will also find a home here. I will try to remember to begin each new project in it's own branch.

I am the only contributer....obviously

Do with this what you will, if you are also a FreeCodeCamp coder I advise you to not peak at my code untill you have completed that project for yourself. If, after you have completed you project, you want to compare code go right ahead. I know for a fact that my code could use refactoring, probably major. If while reading some snippet your brain is screaming at you, which happens, please do add a comment. I can use any constructive criticism.
